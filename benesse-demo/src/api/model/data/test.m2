S I myself have experienced a few volunteer work in my neighborhood , and there are certainly quite a lot of things I learned from each and every one of them . Though all the volunteer work I experienced was about being translators for the upcoming 2020 , there were still many hardships and questions . Most of all , is the language and cultural barrier you face when helping a foreigner . Obviously most foreigners in Japan do n't know much about Japanese cultures and traditions , and Western and Asian cultures are completely different . We were taught in the lecture to try to let go of our prejudice we have as Japanese . These things tend to show while we interact with a foreigner , even if we are not aware . In conclusion , many of us tend to struggle with learning a foreign language , but there is a bigger and harder objective . It is to fully understand the cultural and traditional differences between countries .

S I agree this opinion . I have two reasons . First , I think that when we study at the university , we should not mind the cost . If we mind the cost , we ca n't study something which we want to . second , if there is no cost of university , we can use the money to the lifestyle items . For example , a car , clothes , a bed , a watch , and delicious food . These will make their life wonderful . For these reasons , I should have no cost of university for the students who study at the university .

S I agree with this opinion . Because if we did n't need to spend cost of school , we would study more hard . I might not have money enough to enjoy if spent it . So I do n't wont to study at school . It important for me to take a rest and enjoy playing no the holiday or after school . And to buy new shoes , new clothes and a new car also make me fun . So that does n't do to I have money which I need to do that . I think we need money we enjoy . So I think the cost of school should be disappear .

S I agree with this idea . I have two reasons . First , if univercity 's cost will free , anyone is easy to univercity before . The people who will have not much money do not have to give up to go to univercity . The people who is poor and the people who have much money will be fare in univercity 's test . I think it is very good . Second , students'study skill will be fare is better than unfair . If univercity 's cost will not free , the people who have much money could been good treatment when they became univercity student . It is not good because their study skill will became differ . So the people who is poor and high study skill will became univercity student is better than the people who have much money but low study skill will became univercity student . I hope to univercity 's cost will free .

S I don ` t agree with university should be free the study cost . I have three reasons . First , university should supply us to good study place . Second , money need to increase quality of study . Third , university has a hospital . To good care for patient . But university cost have to down . If poor people want to study in the university , they can ` t pay university cost . I think that cost down need to become flat social .

S I think that money for university should not be free . I have two reason . First , if we are free money for university we study in there easily . But our life move in money . If we do not have to pay money for university , it is not fare . So , we have to pay money for university . Second , if we do n't pay money for university , we should pay money more for other place . For example when we go to hospital , we have to pay money more before . It is suffer older people , difficult sick patient or babies . I think that it is not important money for university is free than creating the town every people feel interesting , good or fun . So , I do n't agree this idea .

S I agree with this idea . I have two reasons for it . First , if Japanese government did it , our country would be better than now and present because more and more students who graduated from the university would make good products and something useful . Second , the student 's parents do n't have to be worry about much money . Because of this , I agree with this idea . I want Japanese government to carry out this idea . thank you for reading .

S I agree to this idea . I have two reasons . First , there may be a student because of money . If they who want to go college do n't have enough money , their dream can not come true . But money of college will be free , number of college students may be increasing . Second , we may be able to spend other things . If We do n't have to pay money , we will be able to buy car , shirt , shoes and so on . And , we may become not to have to work at part time . We will be able to play with friends more . For that reasons , I think money of college should be free .

S There is the opinion that the cost should be free to need to let students study in their university . I disagree to this opinion . I think so because all what university teachers are doing is just career . So being able to go to university is survise from them . If we want some products or survise , we have to pay money to persons who give us them . I think it is same to go to university and study there . If we want to study there because of what we want or need , we may have to have enough attitude , knowledge , skill , and money . Also , the teachers have rights that they can get money for their having doing their job to make thier lives better while they may not tell it . I think paying money is one of the ways to keep society good by making as many people as possible wealthy at least in this country . That 's why , I think we should have money to study in university for protecting social benefits .

S I do not think that college should be free . There are two reason . First , if country pay money in college , people would need money from the government . We will sad . And , people may not offer medical care . Second , there are already several ways for students to go to the college . If families enough not money , students can offer support . Therefore , I do not think college should be free .

S I think that university should be free . I have two reasons . First , if university was free , person who want to go to university would increase . If those person graduated university , person who is expert would increase . Second , person who can not go to university and do not work may decrease . These days , those person is increasing . This is the serious problem in Japan . For those reasons , I think that university should be free .

S I disagree this opinion . I have two reasons . First , if people whoever want to enter a college entered there , price of studying at the college would be nothing . The college is place where people who want to learn about professional things study . So if whoever have many moneys will enter a college with ease , for people who want to study hard there that is unfair . A college is where they should enter . Second , if the cost of studying there will use from country 's money , the cost of hospital have will be decreasing . For example , we wo n't receive treatment . So the cost of studying at the college should not free .
