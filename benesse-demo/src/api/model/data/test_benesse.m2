S I think university should be free for college students .

S I have two reasons .

S I think that we should be exempted from the school fees of university .

S Because , many people hope to enter university .

S I agree with this opinion .

S I have some reasons .

S First , government should help families that have students .

S Students can make our future .

S So to speak , students are future .

S It is one of the important things they live with a joy .

S If it comes true , world will be better and better .

S First , If people who have a grate ability have a little money , they ca n't study at a university .

S I have two reason .
A 3 4|||Mec|||reasons|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S First , If we can go to university with no money , a lot of people can go to university to study .

S For these reasons , I agree with that idea .

S I think the government should give a chance to everyone to study in college without paying money .

S I have two reasons .

S First , it will give poor people a chance to study more .

S These days , many students borrow much money to study in college , and it 's hard for them to pay it for many years .

S Second , it may solve many problems .

S For example , in Japan , the number of children is decreasing .

S I think the reason of the problem is that the young do n't have enough money to live with someone .

S if the young have enough money , they could get marry and many children may be born .

S So I do not think that the cost of school should be free .

S I think we must keep paying to college because of three reasons .

S The first reason is the people who do n't go to any college .

S If we become free from the cost , the goverment has to pay to college .

S So , all people living in Japan must pay to the goverment .

S Then , what will they think ?

S They do n't go to college , but their money get lost .

S I agree that university should be free .

S Today , it costs so much to go to university .

S Some people ca n't go to university because of financial problems .

S This may cause lack of education .

S However , all students must be able to get education equally .

S Also , people can spend money on other things , such as hobbies .

S Studying is not the only important thing for students .

S With more money that they can use freely , they will be able to encourage many skills other than studying , and learn various things that they ca n't learn at university .

S This would help spreading students ' interest .

S For these reasons , I thing that university should be free .

S I think that it is better for us to go to university without tuition .

S Therefore I agree to this opinion .

S I agree with this idea .

S The first reason is that student can get more time to study .

S If tuition is free , they do n't have to work a part time job .

S So they can get more time and focus only study .

S The second reason is that they can choose any school without worrying about money .

S If so , they choose any school freely .

S For these reasons , I agree with this idea .

S I am agree .
A 1 2|||Mec||||||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I agree with the opinion that says money to learn in university should be free .

S I have two reasons .

S First , earning money to learn is too hard for university student .

S Many of them give up their school life for lack of money , so it 's necessary to being free for money to learn .

S Second , the world will become better by a person who has great ability .

S University can make a person like it by helping students who are striving for the world , and it 's dream .

S Money to learn in university should be free to help student 's dream come true .

S I disagree this idea .

S First , if good person want to study in university , the person may have no money .
A 3 3|||Mec|||a|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Practice makes perfect !

S !

S I agree with this idea .

S Because I have a tow reasons .

S First , if we can learn at the university for free , both the rich students and poor students .

S Second , I think we have a right to receive education for free .

S So , I think we must not to violate that right and must respect that rights .

S I agree this idea and think it 's great .

S I have a reason .

S If this system is carried out , more people now are able to go to university .

S In the world , there are people who want to go there but they ca n't because of the poor .

S Thank you for listening to me ! ! !

S !

S I agree to this idea .

S I have two reasons .

S First , it needs a lot of money to the university .

S We have duty to pay the cost of entering the college and studying there .

S If the university where I go is far away form my home , it is also necessary that fare to take buses or trains to go there and money to live at the apartment .

S Our parents must work harder .

S First , if Japanese government did it , our country would be better than now and present because more and more students who graduated from the university would make good products and something useful .

S Second , the student 's parents do n't have to be worry about much money .

S I agree to this idea .

S I have two reasons .

S First , there may be a student because of money .

S If they who want to go college do n't have enough money , their dream can not come true .

S We will be able to play with friends more .

S For that reasons , I think money of college should be free .

S There is the opinion that the cost should be free to need to let students study in their university .

S I disagree to this opinion .

S I think so because all what university teachers are doing is just career .

S So being able to go to university is survise from them .

S If we want some products or survise , we have to pay money to persons who give us them .

S I think it is same to go to university and study there .

S If we want to study there because of what we want or need , we may have to have enough attitude , knowledge , skill , and money .

S Also , the teachers have rights that they can get money for their having doing their job to make thier lives better while they may not tell it .

S I think paying money is one of the ways to keep society good by making as many people as possible wealthy at least in this country .

S That 's why , I think we should have money to study in university for protecting social benefits .

S I do not think that college should be free .

S There are two reason .
