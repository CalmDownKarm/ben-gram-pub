S I dissagree the magazines put in library. Because, many. people come to study in library. If there are many magazines. the person that study in library, reading magazines. They can't study. Also, Many children reads magazines. library is to become very noisy. But. I think so put the magazines of Japanese history. For example. Oda nobunaga. Murasaki shikibu, and Fujiwara no michinaga If these magazines put in library, they can enjoy learning to history. Also, the old story "koten" is change the easy story. (=magazines) Children learn the old story is exciting
