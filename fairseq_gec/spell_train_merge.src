I think that the opinion is nice . Because , money that we have to pay to university is expensive . So we will not be able to spend some money to other things . Enough money to use to other things ; sports , clothes , and daily necessities will make us daily life better . For those reasons , I think that opinion is good for students . 
I agree with this idea . i have three reasons . First , poor people is helped by it . Because , their do n't have money for their children are entered university . but this idea has some problems . For example , poor people can enter the university . so , their may do n't study . Second , I hope to enter the university which I want to enter without we give money . Since I want to study I do n't think that money . Third , poor people should be able to want to study . Because , we may be able to discover the human who have a good head . 
I agree with this idea . I have two reasons . First , high school students want to go to university . But they are not have money to go to university . If to go to university do n't need money , a lot of students can go to school . Second , university students ca n't use money . They think want to use things . For example my brother could not use money for his hobby when he was university student . If to go to university do n't need money , university students can enjoy their own college life . So , I agree with this idea . 
I do n't think the university students pay no money to their universities . I have three reasons . First , the number of student is decreasing now , so we can go to universities whoever want to do . If Japanese government pays money to universities instead of students , they who do n't want to study hard may be made . Second , if the government pay money universities instead of student , it ca n't cover other projects about money . It may be dangerous of the government to pay money instead of all student . For example , Paying money instead of them prevent from covering the hospitals about money . Third , I think that students who have strong mind should go to universities . If we go to universities easily , the quality of university student will be worse . Therefore Japanese economy will be worse , too . This is why I do n't think the university students pay no money to their universities . 
I against opinion that Japanese university 's school expenses should needless to pay . I think that if I did n't pay the university 's school expenses I could use money a lot of way . Although when the opinion came true , a lot of people will be hard . Because a lot of money that paid to university become tax . We life were helped by tax . For example , there are hospitals . 
I agree with the idea . I have two reasons . First , there are many people who want to study very hard in my country . But there are also many people who can not study very hard . Because they are poor . I want them to study very hard . Second , other countries already have introduced the idea . My country should follow the idea . I think that My country is late for the idea . I think they should study very hard , who want to do it . I want them to be a of great smile d' ! ! 
I agree with this idea . I have two reasons . First , some students only have mother or father . They do n't have enough money to go to the private university because the fee of it is so expensive . So they can have fewer choices than other students . Second , some students lent money from the bank when they enter the university . They have to pay money to the bank after graduating university . Because of this , they do n't have enough money to buy something . For example , a car , suits and shoes . Now is not good for every students because it is not fair . We must have a right to learn . So I think the government have to solve this condition as soon as possible . I think one of the answers is that the government pay fee of the university . Do you think the government solve this problem ? I do n't think so . They do n't discuss about it before . They do n't think it is important because all of them are rich . So they do n't have to think about money . Maybe this condition will not change if they find the importance of it . But I hope Japan will have chance to learn at the university for everyone someday . 
I disagree this idea . I think that it is free for us to go to an university . So , if you work since you graduated from your high school soon , it is not necessary to go to a university . I think using the money for other plans , not for this idea . For example , medical , less tax plan , high school 's money and so on to become free . In these examples , I agree with becoming free a high school 's money if this money can use free for other plans . These days , to work at some company , you must be a person who had went to the high school or the university . So you must go to the high school . But there are many people who ca n't go to it because of home 's money problem . To matters worse , they could n't work to live . It is never to be . So I think that do n't using money for university to become free . We should use it for high school to become free . 
I think the money for universities should be free . The reason is the money for universities is too expensive . These days , many students want to go to university . I think it is not true that the student who want to university ca n't go there because she or he has n't enough money . Who want to study more should go to the university . We ca n't go to the university which I want to go because of the money for it . Also , the parents of the students have to save a lot of money . If the money for the university was free , they can spend more money for hospitals , foods , clothes , traveling , and more . Our life would be more fun . For these reasons , I think the money for universities should be free . 
I 'm disagree with this opinion . First reason , going to university is freedom . I think we can work without going there . But I think university students wanted to go there for their future . Not going there is OK . I think going to university is not place under compulsion . Second reason , we need much money to go to high school . I do n't know why we need money to go to high school and do n't need to go to university . So I 'm disagree with this opinion .
